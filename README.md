# Python-Challenge
Repository for pyhton challenge, module 3

Here you can find the files that come with the challenge, which I just copy-pasted
In pybank and pyroll, you can find the resources, and in main.py the comented code,
so the description of every function I used, can be found there.

budget_results.txt, and election_results.txt, were created by the code, so feel free
to delete those files to check the code works fine.

Im so sorry for the delay in the deliver!
